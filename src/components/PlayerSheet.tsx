/**
 * The desktop measure for a player route.
 *
 * The application owns the viewport and the content owns a measure — but only
 * the content. This deliberately paints nothing: no background of its own, no
 * side borders, no elevation. The page surface behind it runs edge to edge and
 * continues straight past the measure, so what a laptop shows is one full-width
 * ShieldQuest surface with readable content down the middle of it.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole point. An earlier version gave the measured
 * column a white background and hairline side borders on the civic canvas, which
 * turned it into a document sheet floating in a light gutter — the "narrow page
 * inside a big browser window" effect the full-bleed shell exists to remove. A
 * measure should decide where text wraps, not draw a page edge.
 *
 * `header` renders outside the measure, full-bleed across the shell, for chrome
 * that should span the application: a district hero, a mission bar, a page bar.
 * Its own contents take the same measure via `sheetMeasure`, so a full-bleed bar
 * never strands its title hundreds of pixels from the column it introduces.

 * Whether motion should be reduced.

 * True when the operating system asks for it, or when the player has asked for
 * it in Settings. The player's own switch can only ever turn motion *down* —
 * someone whose device is set to reduce motion never gets animation back
 * because an app setting says otherwise.
 *
 * Starts false on both the server and the first client render so hydration has
 * nothing to disagree about, then settles in an effect. The CSS in globals.css
 * already covers the OS preference for animations; this hook exists for the
 * behaviour CSS cannot reach — the length of a dice roll, whether the token
 * walks or teleports, whether the board camera pans or jumps.

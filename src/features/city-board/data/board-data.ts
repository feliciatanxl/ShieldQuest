/**
 * ShieldQuest City Board — the roll-and-move track.
 *
 * An original board built from this app's own content. It borrows one thing
 * from tabletop games — the turn rhythm of roll, move, land, play — and nothing
 * else. There is no property, no ownership, no rent, no money to win off other
 * players, no chance/community pile, no jail, no free parking, no railways or
 * utilities, and no board layout, colour banding or trade dress taken from any
 * existing commercial game.
 *
 * ## The dice decides one thing
 *
 * Movement. Nothing else. A roll cannot make a decision safe, cannot pay a
 * Shield Token, cannot level a Guardian and cannot mark anyone a winner. It
 * chooses which situation the player meets next; what they learn from it is
 * decided entirely by the choice they make once they are inside it.
 *
 * ## Why the mix of spaces looks the way it does
 *
 * Nine of the fifteen city activities are built and playable in this prototype,
 * and all four districts now carry at least one — but the six that are not built
 * are still on the track. A district also carries spaces that always have
 * something to say whether or not the player has reached its built content: a
 * district checkpoint, a Guardian checkpoint reporting real learning progress,
 * or a reward checkpoint. Unbuilt activities stay listed and stay labelled
 * "coming soon" rather than being hidden, because pretending they are earnable
 * would be worse than admitting they are not built.
 *
 * The nine playable activities are the single source of the progress figures
 * the player sees; nothing here hard-codes the count. `useWorld` derives it by
 * excluding `PLANNED` nodes, so the board and the Progress screen cannot drift.

 * ShieldQuest City — the district board.
 *
 * The city is an engagement and navigation layer wrapped around the behavioural
 * engine, not a replacement for it. Every node still resolves to a piece of the
 * learning model: a scenario decision, a Peer Shield intervention, a facilitated
 * Think–Vote–Explain round, or a reinforcement mini-game that hands the player
 * back to a scenario.
 *
 * Progression is chosen, never rolled. A player can walk into any district from
 * the first second; only a few later nodes open through completion, and always
 * through completion *within the same district* so the requirement is legible
 * from the tile itself.
 *
 * Content marked `PLANNED` is designed but out of scope for this prototype. It
 * is labelled honestly rather than dressed up as something earnable.

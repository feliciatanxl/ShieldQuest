 * A district's scene.
 *
 * The wide 800×300 district illustration, filling whatever surface it is given.
 * It is absolutely positioned, so the surface decides the height and the scene
 * never adds any — a district can look like somewhere without costing the route
 * below it a single pixel, which on a phone is the point of the screen.
 *
 * Two ways to use it, and the difference matters for contrast:
 *
 *  - As a **band** at full strength, with nothing printed over it. This is how
 *    the district sheet shows it, and it is the only way the artwork is seen
 *    properly.
 *  - As a **wash** behind a header, at low opacity. Only over surfaces whose
 *    text is dark — the mid-greys this app uses for body copy stop meeting AA
 *    long before a wash is strong enough to see.
 *
 * Renders nothing while the slot is empty, leaving the surface exactly as it is
 * without one.

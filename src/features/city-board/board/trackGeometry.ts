 * Geometry for the city track.

 * The board is one long horizontal route that the viewport pans along — a
 * "board camera" — rather than 22 spaces crushed into a phone screen. A player
 * sees six or seven spaces around their token at 390px and can pan to look
 * ahead; a laptop simply sees more of the same route, because the camera is the
 * container's own horizontal scroll rather than a separate desktop layout.
 *
 * Everything below is plain arithmetic on the space index so the route line,
 * the spaces, the district bands and the token all agree without any of them
 * measuring the DOM.

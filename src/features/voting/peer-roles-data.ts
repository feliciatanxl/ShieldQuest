/**
 * Rotating facilitated squad roles for Think · Vote · Explain.
 *
 * ## Why three roles rather than none
 *
 * A group question with no roles is answered by whoever speaks first. Everybody
 * else either agrees or says nothing, which is the exact social dynamic the
 * mechanic is trying to interrupt — and the one that decides what a group chat
 * does about a friend being recruited. Giving three people three different jobs
 * puts three readings of the same situation on the table before anyone has to
 * agree with anything: is this safe, is this true, and how would we help.
 *
 * ## What they are not
 *
 * They are a facilitation device, not a game mechanic. No role is better than
 * another, none of them is scored, none of them changes what the activity
 * awards, and there is no role progression to collect. In a real session a
 * facilitator hands them out and rotates them between rounds so the same young
 * person is not the Safety Lead every time.
 *
 * ## What the prototype can honestly show
 *
 * One device, one participant. This prototype shows the role a participant
 * would be holding and rotates it each time the activity is run, so the
 * rotation itself can be demonstrated end to end. It does not pretend the local
 * player is three connected people, and every surface that shows a role says
 * so.

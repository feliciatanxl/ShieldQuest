/**
 * Think · Vote · Explain content.
 *
 * ## The honest framing, stated once, here
 *
 * The mechanic this file supports is a *facilitated group* mechanic. In a room,
 * the value comes from real people: everyone thinks alone, everyone votes, the
 * room sees its own spread, people say why, and then they decide again. Hearing
 * three classmates give a reason you had not thought of is the intervention.
 *
 * This prototype has no multiplayer, no session server, no cross-device sync
 * and no participant records. The group half is **authored** — the percentages
 * below are written by hand to be plausible for a demonstration, and every
 * surface that renders them says "simulated" on it. They are a demonstration of
 * a mechanic, not a measurement of anybody, and they must never be presented as
 * pilot data.
 *
 * The distributions are deliberately not flattering. The first vote splits with
 * a substantial share on the do-nothing option, because that is what silence in
 * a group chat actually looks like, and the second vote moves but does not
 * resolve to unanimity — a simulation where discussion converts everybody would
 * be a nicer demo and a dishonest one.

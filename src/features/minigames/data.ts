 * Mini-game content.
 *
 * Mini-games are reinforcement, never a replacement for the scenario engine.
 * Each one is deliberately short, pays a small reward next to a scenario
 * decision, and closes by handing the player back to a situation they have
 * played — recognition on its own is trivia.
 *
 * The word-search grid is authored, not generated. Two reasons: a server render
 * and the first client render must be byte-identical (a randomised grid would
 * cause a hydration mismatch), and an authored board can be checked to contain
 * each target word exactly once, so no selection is ambiguous.

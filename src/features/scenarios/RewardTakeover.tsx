/**
 * The immediate payoff, full screen.
 *
 * This is the most load-bearing screen in the whole app, and the easiest one to
 * get wrong. It appears the instant a player accepts an offer that will cost
 * them later, and its entire job is to feel **good** — a big number, a warm
 * green, a genuine congratulation.
 *
 * Nothing here hedges. There is no warning colour, no cautionary copy, no
 * disabled button, no hint that anything is wrong, because the mechanic only
 * teaches if the reward lands honestly first. A player who is told at this
 * moment that they made a mistake learns "risky choices feel bad immediately",
 * which is the opposite of how recruitment actually works on people.
 *
 * It is deliberately non-blocking: the delayed consequence is already counting
 * down from the decision, so it arrives on its own schedule whether the player
 * is still looking at this screen or has moved on.
